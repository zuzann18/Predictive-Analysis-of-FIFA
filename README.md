Predictive Analysis of FIFA World Cup 2022
# World Cup Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict outcomes of the FIFA World Cup, leveraging a data-driven approach to explore patterns, performances, and predict future match results. 

## Objectives
- To analyze historical data of World Cup matches.
- To predict match outcomes based on statistical modeling.

## Feature Engineering:
New features were engineered, including FIFA rankings and match-specific variables like team groupings for the World Cup. These features are predictors that significantly influence match outcomes and were included to enhance model accuracy.

Cleaning and Structuring: After loading the data, the initial steps involved converting the date column to a datetime format, which is critical for time series analysis.
data cleaning :handling missing values by removing any records with incomplete data
Categorical and Numerical Variable Processing: Key variables included the match outcome, which was treated as a categorical dependent variable (win, loss, draw). Numerical data such as match scores were also crucial and underwent normalization to ensure they were properly scaled for the predictive models.



## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and model development.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Compiled historical World Cup data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, transforming categorical data, and creating training and test datasets.
Feature Engineering: Deriving new features like team rank differences and historical performance metrics.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed trends and patterns using visualizations.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning models to forecast match outcomes.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance with cross-validation techniques.
